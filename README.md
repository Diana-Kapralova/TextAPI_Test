# TextAPI_Test
## Task
This is project repository as a Test to the course **Machine Learning in Production**
There are several stages in that test:
### Stage 1 (required):
Implement any NLP model for this problem: https://www.kaggle.com/c/commonlitreadabilityprize/overview
The final RMSE metric doesn't matter here, the goal here is just to get a trained model.
**Output:**
* python script for training
* trained model with metrics
* README with information on how to reproduce our solution

### Stage 2 (optional)
Write an API server for the trained model form Stage1. The API should contain only 1 endpoint for prediction:
**Output:**
* python script for running API
* README with information on how to reproduce our solution

### Stage 3 (optional)
Deploy API from Stage2 and send the endpoint for testing.
**Output:**
* API endpoint
